        <h1>I'm So Sorry, euodi! ü•∫</h1>
        <p>I was acting like a total retard yesterday night. I was into myself so much that I dismissed your circumstances and the effort you've been putting in despite all the things you are juggling. I hope you know how I acted yesterday wasn't because I wanted to hurt you or make you feel dismissed, and it wasn't a reflection of my love and commitment towards you. I wasn't  taking into consideration how you were stretched too thin and still was trying to be there for me as much as you could. I was too focused on my emotions to let myself see and understand yours. You are right, you shouldn't have been the one to apologize for something I took and interpreted in bad light. I'm sorry for the headache I caused. I'm sorry for giving you additional stress on top of what you already have. I don't expect you to immediately accept my apology, but I want it to be said. I thought it'd be better if i did it this way instead of just sending you another senseless paragraph on instagram. by the way I had to learn how to code and create this from scratch. I think its worth every single second I spent on it. I hope you'll enloy the rest of the webpageüôèüò≠</p>
